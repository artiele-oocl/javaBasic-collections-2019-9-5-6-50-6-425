# Summary

Please answer the following 4 questions for each unit test:
1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

## ArrayTest
#### should_resize_array
1. This task is about familiarity with manipulating simple array.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_arrays.htm
2. Test failed because expected method were not correctly implemented.
3. I corrected it that way by following the logic flow and realizing how array structures data. 
4. None.

## CollectionsTest
#### should_go_through_an_iterator
1. This task is about familiarity with manipulating simple array.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/Collections.html
2. Test failed because methods were not implemented correctly.
3. Familiarity with Collection API.
4. None.

#### should_create_a_sequence_without_putting_all_items_into_memory
1. This task is about familiarity with manipulating simple array.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/Collections.html
2. Test failed because methods were not implemented correctly.
3. Familiarity with Collection API.
4. None.

#### should_predict_linked_list_operation_result
1. This task is about familiarity with manipulating simple array.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/Collections.html
2. It did not work because array is empty. 
3. Familiarity with LinkedList Collection.
4. None.

#### should_generate_distinct_sequence_on_the_fly
1. ?
2. ?
3. ?
4. ?

#### should_reflects_back_to_original_list_for_sub_range
1. Familiarity with subList().
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html
2. Test failed because it is not the expected list.
3. This simply extracted a sublist given specific indices; in our case fromIndex 3, inclusive, and toIndex 10, exclusive.
4. None.
